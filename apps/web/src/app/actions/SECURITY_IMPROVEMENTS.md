# Server Actions Security Hardening Implementation

## Overview

This document summarizes the security hardening and quality improvements implemented for Server Actions based on Issue #363.

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Input Validation with Zod Schemas

**File:** `/app/actions/validation/accounting-periods.ts`

- Created comprehensive Zod validation schemas for all accounting periods operations
- Validates input data types, formats, and business rules
- Prevents SQL injection through schema validation
- Added regex patterns to prevent XSS attacks in text fields

### 2. Type Safety Improvements

**File:** `/app/actions/utils/type-guards.ts`

- Replaced unsafe type assertions with proper type guards
- Created `hasUserOrgRole()` and `extractUserRole()` functions
- Added type guards for UUID, date strings, and other common types
- Ensures runtime type safety matches TypeScript compile-time checks

### 3. SQL Injection Prevention

**File:** `/app/actions/accounting-periods.ts`

- Fixed SQL query construction in `checkPeriodOverlap()` function
- Replaced string interpolation with proper parameterized queries
- Added `isValidSqlIdentifier()` validation for dynamic column names
- Prevents malicious SQL code execution

### 4. Rate Limiting

**File:** `/app/actions/utils/rate-limiter.ts`

- Implemented in-memory rate limiting for sensitive operations
- Added specific limits for DELETE operations (5 requests/minute)
- Configurable rate limits for different operation types
- Prevents abuse and DoS attacks on critical endpoints

### 5. Audit Logging Improvements

**Files:** `/app/actions/accounting-periods.ts`, `/app/actions/audit-logs.ts`

- Added comprehensive audit logging for all CRUD operations
- Enhanced error logging with detailed context information
- Non-blocking audit log failures (operations continue even if logging fails)
- Structured logging for better monitoring and debugging

### 6. Transaction Management

While Supabase doesn't support traditional transactions in the same way as raw PostgreSQL, we've implemented:

- Atomic operations where possible
- Proper error handling and rollback patterns
- Audit logging that captures both old and new values for rollback scenarios

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### Input Validation

- All user inputs are validated before processing
- Schema validation using Zod for type safety
- Sanitization of search queries and text inputs
- Prevention of XSS through regex validation

### Authentication & Authorization

- Consistent authentication checks at the beginning of each function
- Role-based access control with proper type guards
- Organization-level access validation
- Prevention of privilege escalation

### Error Handling

- No sensitive information leaked in error messages
- Consistent error response format
- Proper logging of errors for debugging
- Different error messages for development vs production

### Rate Limiting

- Protection against abuse of delete operations
- Configurable limits based on operation sensitivity
- Client identification using IP and user ID
- Automatic cleanup of expired rate limit entries

## Files Modified

1. **New Files Created:**
   - `/app/actions/validation/accounting-periods.ts` - Zod validation schemas
   - `/app/actions/utils/type-guards.ts` - Type guard utilities
   - `/app/actions/utils/rate-limiter.ts` - Rate limiting middleware

2. **Files Updated:**
   - `/app/actions/accounting-periods.ts` - Main implementation with all security fixes
   - `/app/actions/audit-logs.ts` - Enhanced error logging

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Input Validation Testing**
   - Test with malformed data
   - Test SQL injection attempts
   - Test XSS attempts in text fields

2. **Rate Limiting Testing**
   - Test rapid delete operations
   - Verify rate limit reset after timeout
   - Test different user/IP combinations

3. **Authorization Testing**
   - Test access with different user roles
   - Verify organization-level access control
   - Test privilege escalation attempts

4. **Audit Log Testing**
   - Verify all operations are logged
   - Test audit log failure scenarios
   - Check log completeness and accuracy

## Migration Notes

When updating existing code to use these security improvements:

1. Import the validation schemas and use `validateInput()` helper
2. Replace type assertions with the new type guards
3. Add rate limiting to sensitive operations
4. Ensure audit logging is added to all CRUD operations
5. Update error handling to use the structured format

## Future Improvements

1. **Distributed Rate Limiting**
   - Consider Redis for production rate limiting
   - Implement sliding window rate limiting

2. **Enhanced Transaction Support**
   - Investigate Supabase transaction support
   - Implement saga patterns for complex operations

3. **Security Headers**
   - Add CSP headers for XSS prevention
   - Implement CORS properly

4. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Set up alerts for rate limit violations
   - Monitor audit log failures
   - Track suspicious activity patterns

## Compliance

These security improvements help meet:

- OWASP Top 10 security requirements
- GDPR audit trail requirements
- Japanese financial regulation compliance
- General security best practices for financial applications
