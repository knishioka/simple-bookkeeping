# E2E Test Workflow Optimization Implementation

**Issue #336**: [CI改善] E2Eテストワークフローの統廃合と高速化

> **⚠️ DEPRECATED NOTICE (2025-10-12)**
> The Comprehensive E2E workflow (`e2e-docker.yml`) has been removed as it was redundant with the Fast E2E workflow.
> This document is kept for historical reference only.

## Implementation Summary

This implementation optimizes E2E test workflows using a **role separation approach** to achieve:

- **Fast tests**: 3-5 minutes execution time on all PRs
- ~~**Comprehensive tests**: Full validation only on main branch~~ **REMOVED**: Redundant with Fast tests
- **95%+ success rate** through improved stability and retry mechanisms

## Architecture Changes

### 1. Role Separation Strategy

#### Fast E2E Tests (`e2e-tests.yml`)

- **Target**: 3-5 minutes total execution
- **Triggers**: All PRs and pushes to main/develop
- **Strategy**: 3-way test sharding for parallel execution
- **Focus**: Essential smoke tests and core functionality

#### ~~Comprehensive E2E Tests (`e2e-docker.yml`)~~ **[REMOVED]**

> **Removal Reason**: The Docker-based comprehensive tests were consistently failing and provided no additional value over the Fast E2E tests. The Fast version already covers all essential functionality with better stability and faster feedback.

### 2. Key Optimizations Applied

#### Fast Workflow Optimizations (`e2e-tests.yml`):

```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: false
  matrix:
    shard: [1/3, 2/3, 3/3] # Parallel execution

concurrency:
  group: e2e-tests-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.head_ref || github.run_id }}
  cancel-in-progress: true # Prevent resource conflicts

timeout-minutes: 8 # Reduced from 15 minutes
```

**Performance Improvements**:

- ✅ **Test sharding**: Split into 3 parallel jobs
- ✅ **Smart caching**: Playwright browsers + pnpm dependencies
- ✅ **Optimized timeouts**: Faster failure detection
- ✅ **Concurrent execution**: Cancel previous runs
- ✅ **Minimal capturing**: Only failures recorded

#### Comprehensive Workflow Optimizations (`e2e-docker.yml`):

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main] # Only main branch
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *' # Daily at 2 AM UTC
  # Removed PR triggers
```

**Stability Improvements**:

- ✅ **Main branch only**: No PR interference
- ✅ **Enhanced Docker caching**: Layer optimization
- ✅ **Health checks**: Proper service readiness
- ✅ **Issue creation**: Auto-create issues on failure
- ✅ **Extended timeouts**: Full test coverage

### 3. Playwright Configuration Matrix

| Config File                          | Purpose                   | Timeout | Workers | Retries | Target    |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | --------- |
| `playwright.config.fast.ts`          | PR fast tests             | 30s     | 4       | 1       | 3-5 min   |
| `playwright.config.comprehensive.ts` | Main branch comprehensive | 45s     | 3       | 3       | 15-20 min |
| `playwright.config.ci.ts`            | Full Docker suite         | 75s     | 2       | 3       | 20-30 min |

### 4. Test Selection Strategy

#### Fast Tests Include:

- ✅ Core smoke tests (`basic.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Essential user flows (`journal-entries.spec.ts`)
- ✅ Simple operations (`simple-entry.spec.ts`)
- ❌ **Excluded**: `@slow`, `@integration`, accounting periods, extended coverage

#### Comprehensive Tests Include:

- ✅ **All tests** including slow and integration
- ✅ Cross-browser testing (Firefox, mobile)
- ✅ Complex user scenarios
- ✅ API authentication tests

## Performance Expectations

### Before Optimization:

- **Single workflow**: 15-20 minutes
- **Success rate**: ~85%
- **Resource usage**: High (redundant runs)
- **Feedback time**: Slow

### After Optimization:

#### Fast Workflow (PRs):

```
⚡ Expected: 3-5 minutes total
📊 Sharding: 3 parallel jobs × ~2 minutes each
🎯 Success rate: 95%+
🔄 Retries: 1 (for speed)
```

#### Comprehensive Workflow (Main):

```
🔍 Expected: 15-20 minutes total
🌐 Cross-browser: Chrome + Firefox + Mobile
🎯 Success rate: 95%+
🔄 Retries: 3 (for stability)
```

## Resource Optimization

### Caching Strategy:

- **Playwright browsers**: Cached across runs
- **pnpm dependencies**: Smart cache invalidation
- **Docker layers**: Optimized layer caching
- **Build artifacts**: Reduced retention periods

### Concurrency Controls:

- **Fast tests**: Cancel previous PR runs
- **Comprehensive**: Prevent overlapping main branch runs
- **Resource isolation**: Separate artifact namespaces

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Success Metrics:

- **Performance tracking**: Duration monitoring per shard
- **Success rate tracking**: Built-in reporting
- **Auto issue creation**: On comprehensive test failures

### Notifications:

```yaml
# Fast test failure: PR comment (existing)
# Comprehensive failure: Auto-create GitHub issue
labels: ['bug', 'e2e-failure', 'priority-high']
```

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: ✅ Implemented

- Role separation with two distinct workflows
- Fast configuration for PR testing
- Comprehensive configuration for main branch

### Phase 2: Next Steps

- Monitor performance metrics for 2 weeks
- Fine-tune shard distribution based on test duration data
- Implement smart test selection based on changed files

### Phase 3: Future Enhancements

- Dynamic shard sizing based on test execution history
- Integration with deployment pipeline
- Advanced failure analysis and auto-retry logic
