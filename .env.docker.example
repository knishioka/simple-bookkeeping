# Note: The anon key above is a test-only dummy key that:
# 1. Does not connect to any real Supabase instance
# 2. Is paired with a non-existent URL (dummy.supabase.co)
# 3. Is safe to commit to version control as it has no security implications
# 4. Allows the middleware to detect test environment and bypass authentication
